                <h2>The Mysteries of Black Holes: Unraveling the Universe's Darkest Secrets</h2>
                <p class="date">Posted on July 30, 2024</p>
                <p>Black holes are among the most fascinating objects in the universe, known for their powerful gravitational pull from which nothing, not even light, can escape. They form when massive stars collapse under their own gravity, creating a singularityâ€”a point of infinite density.</p>
                
                <h3>Types of Black Holes</h3>
                <p>There are three main types of black holes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stellar Black Holes:</strong> Formed from collapsing stars, these have masses up to 20 times that of the Sun.</li>
                    <li><strong>Intermediate Black Holes:</strong> With masses between 100 to 1000 times the Sun, these are less common and harder to detect.</li>
                    <li><strong>Supermassive Black Holes:</strong> Found at the centers of galaxies, including our Milky Way, they have millions to billions of solar masses.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Why Black Holes Matter</h3>
                <p>Black holes play a crucial role in the universe, influencing the formation and evolution of galaxies. They are key to understanding gravity and the fundamental laws of physics.</p>
                
                <h3>Exploring the Unknown</h3>
                <p>Studying black holes helps scientists explore the boundaries of space and time. Advances in technology, such as the Event Horizon Telescope, continue to unveil their secrets, providing glimpses into these cosmic enigmas.</p>
